# B-Critics Website Repo

## Code Types
There are four different types of files on here:
- Data
- Modules
- Pages
  - Other
<br/>
Data feeds into Modules and Pages.
Modules and Pages are the visual end-products. Modules can be embedded within a Google sites page (implication: Liz & Court can edit the page still), whereas Pages are literally the page (must be edited via code e.g. the Episode tiles).
Other category is reserved for weird shit because I don't know what I'm doing.<br/>

### Data
